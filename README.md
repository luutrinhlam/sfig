# sfig

This project was created using GIPHY API, with the help of Material UI library and Swiper.
This was a 4-day-coding project, so there must be some weaknesses. Although I tried so hard to provide the theme for the whole application using MUI, there are some places that the designs/colors are not synchronized with each others due to the embedment of GIPHY APIs/Components. There are some features that are developing: Artist, Random GIFs. If I had time I would spent on the synchronization of the whole website as well as developing those leftover features.
